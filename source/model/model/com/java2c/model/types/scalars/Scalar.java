/*
    A Scalar is used to define that a class represents a scalar value, such as c_signed_char

    The value is the C type (eg 'signed char')

    A Scalar has a single constructor which takes a Java long. Thus

    c_signed_char x = new c_signed_char(100L)

        is transformed into

    signed char x = 100

    (with appropriate conversion of 100L)

    Scalars are implicitly @Uncastable
